# README

### Brief
This repo contains the codebase for a toy language called Cask. Cask is a statically and strongly typed programming language that is compiled to stack VM bytecode. It follows the procedural paradigm and _might_ gain generics someday.

### Documentation:
 - `grammar.md` specifies the syntax rules of Cask.
 - `samples.md`

### Roadmap:
 - [] Finish Lexer.
 - [] Finish Parser.
 - [] Refactor Lexer and Parser if needed.
 - [] Create bytecode compiler.
 - [] Create stack based VM.
